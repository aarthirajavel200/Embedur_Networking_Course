Qusetion : IMPACT OF DUPLICATE IPs:
------------------------------------

ARP Conflicts & Flapping:
--------------------------
When duplicate IPs exist, ARP requests on the network receive responses from both devices. 
The ARP cache on other devices may “flap” (alternate) between the two MAC addresses,
leading to intermittent connectivity or complete communication breakdown. 

Operating System Responses:
-----------------------------
Many operating systems detect duplicate IP addresses and issue error messages 
(for example, Windows might display an “IP address conflict” notification). In some cases, 
the network interface may be disabled to prevent further issues. 

Impact on Network Services:
--------------------------
Critical services like DHCP may inadvertently assign an already-used IP if static addresses 
overlap with dynamic ranges, worsening the conflict. Such misconfigurations can slow network performance and make troubleshooting more challenging. 

IPv6 Considerations:
---------------------
With IPv6, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol uses Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to check for conflicts before activating an address. 
If a duplicate is detected, the device will usually not use that IP, preventing the conflict from affecting network operations
